Predicting IMDB scores

Our project implements a number of machine learning algorithms to analyze information about various popular movies released between 1916 and 2016. The objective of our machine learning model is to predict the ratings the movies received by users on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB). The model attempts to predict the movies’ IMDB score within the closest integer value using NumPy’s “round” method.
